# Data Mining Projects

## [Decision Tree Classification and Evaluation](./Decision%20Tree%20Classification%20and%20Evaluation.html)
- Built and evaluated decision tree classifiers for a dataset.
- Analyzed feature importance and model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Applied hyperparameter tuning to optimize tree depth and splitting criteria.

## [A5 - Data Preprocessing and Clustering](./A5_Silverstein_Scott.html)
- Conducted data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and normalization.
- Applied K-Means clustering to identify patterns and groups in the dataset.
- Evaluated clustering results using silhouette scores and other validation metrics.

## [A6 - Association Rule Mining](./a6_silverstein_scott.html)
- Implemented Apriori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets in transaction data.
- Generated association rules and analyzed confidence and support metrics.
- Provided actionable insights based on the extracted rules for decision-making.
